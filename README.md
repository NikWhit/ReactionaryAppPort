# ReactPortfolio - Built on Netlify and finaly deployed

2nd Attempt: Taking the advise of the program graders, I've successfully deployed my program on Netlify. https://main--silly-panda-a5f52c.netlify.app/
It is crude and unpolished, and given more time, I can clean it up. I'm just so incredibly glad that it finally deployed. There were a few more issues. I typo of one capital letter was holding up my progress, and the vite build was a major issue too.
What I had to do was to create a whole new repo, set up a new netlify, reconstruct everything but drag the code to the right places. But I got it to work. Thank you.

To see full commit message updates, please refer the the original repo that I submitted. Thanks.

# Installation
Run the dependencies with npm install, npm run start gets the localhost to take you to a page. Npm run dev, npm run build are in the package.json.

# Usage

It should look like this.
