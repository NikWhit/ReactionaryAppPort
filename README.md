# ReactPortfolio

# Description 
This builds you a little react portfolio page app. It should show you images in the portfolio tab that equate to my class projects. It should also take you to my real resume. There is contact information if you go to my personal website. The link is on the page. 

# Installation
Run the dependencies with npm install, npm run start gets the localhost to take you to a page. Npm run dev, npm run build are in the package.json.
